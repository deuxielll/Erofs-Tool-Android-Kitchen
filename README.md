1.  **Place your images:** Copy the image files you want to unpack into the `original_images` directory.
2.  **Run the script:** Execute the main helper script with root privileges:
    ```bash
    sudo ./erofs-helper.sh
    ```
3.  **Choose an option from the menu:**
    *   **Unpack an image:** Select an image file from the `original_images` directory to extract. The contents will be placed in a new folder inside the `extracted_images` directory.
    *   **Repack a directory:** Choose a directory from `extracted_images` to repack into a new image. You will be prompted to select the output filesystem (EROFS or EXT4) and compression options. The new image will be saved in the `repacked_images` directory.
    *   **Clean All (Danger):** Deletes the contents of the `original_images`, `extracted_images`, and `repacked_images` directories to provide a clean workspace.
    *   **Exit:** Closes the script.

### F2FS Filesystem Support

For F2FS filesystem support, you may need to load the kernel module first:
```bash
sudo modprobe f2fs
```
